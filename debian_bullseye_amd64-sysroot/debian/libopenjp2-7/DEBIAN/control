Description: JPEG 2000 image compression/decompression library
 OpenJPEG is a library for handling the JPEG 2000 image compression format.
 JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard and permits progressive
 transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy for progressive downloads of an
 encoded image. It supports lossless and lossy compression, supports higher
 compression than JPEG 1991, and has resilience to errors in the image.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files for openjpeg 2.x
