Description: simple interprocess messaging system (session bus configuration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package contains the configuration files defining the behaviour of
 the D-Bus session bus, used for applications and per-user services.
 These are used by the reference implementation in the dbus package,
 and by the reimplementation in the dbus-broker package.
 .
 To provide a complete D-Bus session bus, install one of the packages
 that implement the dbus-session-bus virtual package, such as
 dbus-user-session. The recommended implementation is indicated by
 the default-dbus-session-bus virtual package.
