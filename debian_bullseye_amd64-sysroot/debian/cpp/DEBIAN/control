Description: GNU C preprocessor (cpp)
 The GNU C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically
 by the GNU C compiler to transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the compiler.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default GNU C preprocessor.
