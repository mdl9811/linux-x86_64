Description: X Keyboard Extension (XKB) configuration data
 This package contains configuration data used by the X Keyboard
 Extension (XKB), which allows selection of keyboard layouts when
 using a graphical interface.
 .
 Every X11 vendor provides its own XKB data files, so keyboard layout
 designers have to send their layouts to several places.  The
 xkeyboard-config project has been launched at FreeDesktop in order
 to provide a central repository that could be used by all vendors.
