Description: Generic OpenCL ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package contains an installable client driver loader (ICD Loader)
 library that can be used to load any (free or non-free) installable client
 driver (ICD) for OpenCL. It acts as a demultiplexer so several ICD can
 be installed and used together.
