Description: Qt 6 D-Bus module
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 The QtDBus module is a Unix-only library that you can use to make Inter-Process
 Communication using the D-Bus protocol.
 .
 Applications using the QtDBus module can provide services to other, remote
 applications by exporting objects, as well as use services exported by those
 applications by placing calls and accessing properties.
