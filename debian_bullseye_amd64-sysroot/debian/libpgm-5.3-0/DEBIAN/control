Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.
