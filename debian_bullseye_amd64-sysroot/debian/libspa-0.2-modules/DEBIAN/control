Description: libraries for the PipeWire multimedia server Simple Plugin API - modules
 PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia
 pipelines. This includes:
 .
  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
    application provided streams) and multiplexing this with clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.
 .
 This package contains core support modules used in the Simple Plugin API,
 together with test and utility modules that do not introduce additional
 dependencies. It should not normally be depended on directly: PipeWire
 clients should depend on the pipewire package instead.
